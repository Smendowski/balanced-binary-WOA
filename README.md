## Overview

<p align="justify">
With the growing prominence of cloud computing, research efforts have increasingly focused on optimizing resource
utilization. As highlighted in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10723-024-09792-0">a recent survey</a>, resource
prediction and resource planning have emerged as two of the most rapidly advancing optimization areas. Consequently,
this research work operates at the intersection of resource-efficient computing, data-centric artificial intelligence,
and bio-inspired optimization by proposing an original dynamic feature selection method — the <strong>Balanced
Binary Whale Optimization Algorithm (BB-WOA)</strong>. The method is specifically designed to enhance the predictive
performance of regression models tasked with resource usage forecasting in the context of Green Cloud Computing.

## Experiments

<p align="justify">

1. All experiments were conducted within the Microsoft Azure Cloud environment. A comprehensive specification of the
   configuration setup is available in the [Azure](AZURE.md) file.
2. All experimental scenarios can be found in the [scenarios](scenarios) directory. The raw results obtained from
   the conducted experiments are located in the [raw results](data/results/raw) directory, while the consolidated
   results can be found in the [merged results](data/results/merged) directory.
3. The implementation of the Balanced Binary WOA can be found in the [woa](src/woa) directory.
4. Analysis and intermediate studies are provided in the Jupyter Notebooks located in the [notebooks](notebooks) directory.
